# `commons` ðŸ“¦

## Description

`commons` is a Python 3 library containing useful implementations for all CRS modules:
- Utility functions and classes;
- Interfaces; and
- Enumerations.

The enumerations are not exhaustive. They define the minimal set of members that are used in OpenCRS. For example, `InputStreams` doesn't define an `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE` (a valid input stream for an executable) as this case is not tacked yet by the project.

## Setup

Install the required Python 3 packages via `poetry install --no-dev`.

## Usage

Depends on each file in the library.
